## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

- At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the interactions between the `UI` and `Logic` components when executing a `Find` name command attribute on the updated UI.

<puml src="diagrams/UiFindSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions between the UI and Logic Components for the `find n/john` command" />

### Logic component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"></puml>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

- stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
- stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>

### Storage component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
- inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Adding a Tutor: `add`

Adds a new tutor profile to Tuto.
The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions between the Logic and Model components during the execution of the `add` command.

<puml src="diagrams/AddSequenceDiagram.puml" width="550"></puml>

The `add` command is processed in two main phases: parsing and execution.
The input string from user is first parsed into an `Person` object, which is then wrapped in an `AddCommand` object and executed to update the `Model` object.

The sequence of interactions is as follows:

1. The user enters the `add` command with the correct arguments, which is received by `LogicManager`.
2. `LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser` to parse the input.
3. `AddressBookParser` identifies the command word and delegates parsing to `AddCommandParser`.
4. `AddCommandParser` parses the arguments and constructs a `Person` object based on the given attributes stated in the arguments.
5. `AddCommandParser` creates an `AddCommand` object containing the `Person`.
6. The `AddCommand` is returned to `LogicManager`.
7. `LogicManager` executes the command by calling `AddCommand#execute(Model)`.
8. `AddCommand` performs validation checks if same phone and email already exists.
9. If all checks pass, the `Person` is added to the `Model`.
10. A `CommandResult` is created and returned to the user.

#### Alternative flows

- If the input format from user is invalid, a `ParseException` is thrown during parsing and the `command` object is not created.
- If the phone or email already exists in Tuto, a `CommandException` is thrown and the operation is aborted.

---

### Uniqueness Constraints

To ensure data integrity, the application enforces uniqueness constraints across tutor profiles.

#### Current Implementation

The uniqueness of a `Person` is determined by the following fields:

- Phone number
- Email address

Duplicate checks are performed in `AddCommand` and `EditCommand` before delegating to the model.
If a duplicate is detected, a `CommandException` is thrown immediately with an appropriate error message.

If any of the following conditions are met:

- A person with the same phone number already exists
- A person with the same email address already exists

The operation is rejected and an appropriate error message is shown to the user.

Duplicate checks are performed in the following priority:

1. Phone number
2. Email address

This ensures that phone number conflict is detected first, followed by email address conflict.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: What defines a duplicate person**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use phone number, and email address as uniqueness constraints
    - Pros: Prevents duplicate entries effectively and maintains clean data
    - Cons: May be restrictive in cases where users share names or contact details
- **Alternative 2:** Use full object equality
    - Pros: Simpler implementation
    - Cons: Allows duplicate entries with identical contact details

**Aspect: Rates are restricted to whole numbers**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Rates are restricted to whole numbers
    - Pros: Reflects common real-world practice, where tutors typically state their hourly rates as whole numbers
    - Cons: Does not account for edge cases where fractional rates (e.g. $25.50/hour) may be used
- **Alternative 2:** Rates allow decimal values
    - Pros: More flexible and accommodates all possible pricing formats
    - Cons: Adds unnecessary complexity for a feature that is rarely used in practice

**Aspect: Address field is optional**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Address field is optional
    - Pros: Accounts for the case where tuition may be done online and hence tutor's address is not needed
    - Cons: User may forget to add address field of tutor in cases where face-to-face tuition is arranged and address is needed to meet the tutor
- **Alternative 2:** Address field is mandatory
    - Pros: Serves as a reminder to user to record address of tutor in cases where face-to-face tuition is arranged
    - Cons: Does not account for the case where tuition may be done online and hence tutor's address is not needed

#### Class Diagram

The following class diagram shows the key classes involved in enforcing uniqueness constraints,
and how they interact structurally.

`AddCommand` and `EditCommand` depend on the `Model` interface to perform duplicate checks.
`ModelManager` implements `Model` and delegates to `AddressBook`, which contains a
`UniquePersonList` that stores all `Person` objects.

### Finding a Tutor: `find`

Finds a tutor profile saved in Tuto. The sequence diagrams below illustrate the interactions between the UI, Logic, and Model
components during the execution of the `find` command.

The `find` command is processed in two main phases: parsing the query to construct the appropriate predicate, and executing the search to update the `Model` and `UI`.

The sequence of interactions is as follows:

1. The user enters the `find` command with the search keywords, which is received by `LogicManager`.
2. `LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser` to parse the input.
3. `AddressBookParser` identifies the command word and delegates parsing to `FindCommandParser`.
4. `FindCommandParser` parses the arguments and constructs a predicate based on the search criteria.
5. `FindCommandParser` creates a `FindCommand` object containing the constructed predicate.
6. The `FindCommand` is returned to `LogicManager`.
7. `LogicManager` executes the command by calling `FindCommand#execute(Model)`.
8. `FindCommand` calls `Model#updateFilteredPersonList(...)` using the predicate to filter the displayed list.
9. `FindCommand` generates a `CommandResult` containing the `foundPersons` (the filtered list) and a `description` of the search query. This result is returned to the user interface.
10. The UI receives the `CommandResult`. Notably, it updates the query bar (`ResultDisplay`) to display the description of what was searched, then lists the internally matched tutors.

The diagram below shows how the UI interactions are executed after the command returns.

<puml src="diagrams/UiFindSequenceDiagram.puml" />

The diagram below illustrates the interactions inside the Logic and Model components.

<puml src="diagrams/FindSequenceDiagram.puml" />

The diagram below shows the parser classes involved in handling the `find` command.

<puml src="diagrams/FindParserClassDiagram.puml" width="500"/>

#### Alternative flows

- If the search arguments are empty or invalid, a `ParseException` is thrown during parsing and the `Command` object is not created.
- If the search yields no matches, `FindCommand` still executes successfully. The displayed list is simply empty, but the query bar in the UI is still appropriately updated to show what keywords were searched.

#### Search Modalities

The `find` command supports three modalities of searching, enabling users to find tutor profiles flexibly:

**1. General Search (Universal Search)**
Users can provide keywords without any prefixes.

- **Example:** `find alice math`
- **Implementation:** The `FindCommandParser` treats these prefix-less keywords as the preamble. It extracts these keywords and constructs a `UniversalSearchPredicate`. This predicate evaluates if **any** of the tutor's relevant fields (such as name, subject, or tags) match the specified keywords.

**2. Attribute Filtering**
Users can search for specific attributes using prefixes (e.g., `n/`, `s/`, `r/`, `t/`).

- **Example:** `find n/alice r/10-30`
- **Implementation:** `FindCommandParser` parses the mapped values for each specified prefix.
    - It creates specific predicates for each attribute (e.g., `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `RateRangePredicate`, `SubjectContainsKeywordsPredicate`).
    - Multiple occurrences of keywords or prefixes are supported. For names (`n/Alice Peter`), space-separated keywords are evaluated using OR logic (returns profiles matching any of the names). For subjects and tags (e.g., `s/Math s/Physics`), multiple occurrences of the prefix itself are evaluated using AND logic within their respective predicates (returns profiles matching all specified prefixes).
    - Rate filtering dynamically handles various mathematical boundaries (e.g., exact `r/50`, ranges `r/40-60`, or inequalities `r/<50`).

**3. General Search + Attribute Filtering**
Users can combine general search keywords with specific attribute filters to effectively refine their results.

- **Example:** `find alice r/<50`
- **Implementation:** When `FindCommandParser` detects both a preamble and specific prefixes, it validates that only supported refinement prefixes (`n/`, `s/`, `r/`, `t/`) are used to prevent logical conflicts. It then constructs a **combined predicate** by chaining the `UniversalSearchPredicate` and the attribute-specific predicates together using a logical `AND` (`Predicate.and()`). This ensures the displayed list heavily filters the broad keyword search against the strict attribute constraints.

#### Design Considerations

##### Aspect: Search Modalities and User Experience

The design of the `find` command heavily factors in natural human searching patterns and the progressive disclosure of complexity.

- **Low-information exploration (Typing less to discover more):** When a user is unsure of exact profile details, they logically gravitate towards broad, search-engine-style keyword searches. The **General (Universal) Search** caters to this by requiring zero prefixes, lowering the cognitive barrier and friction to entry. If you don't know exactly what you want, you type less.
- **High-information precision (Determinate filtering):** When a user knows exactly what they want (e.g., a specific name under a strict budget), they need structured tools to zero-in on candidates. **Attribute Filtering** provides rigorous control. The more you know, the more you filter.
- **Progressive refinement:** The **General Search + Attribute Filtering** modality allows users to cast a wide net initially, completely naturally, and optionally tack on filters to eliminate noise once they see the broad results.

**Alternative 1 (Current choice): Flexible multi-modal search (Universal + Attributes)**

- **Pros:** Scales dynamically with the user's familiarity and immediate needs. It models real-world workflows seamlessly.
- **Cons / Opportunity costs:** Significantly increases the architectural complexity of the `FindCommandParser`. It introduces edge-case ambiguities where universal keywords logically clash with prefix arguments, requiring us to enforce explicit validation rules (e.g., restricting which abstract prefixes can confidently be used alongside universal search) and write much more comprehensive unit tests for combinations.

**Alternative 2: Strict prefix-only search (Default behavior)**

- **Pros:** Extremely straightforward to implement and parse. It completely eliminates ambiguity in user intent.
- **Cons:** High friction UX. Users are forced to remember and strictly type specific prefixes (`n/`, `s/`) even for the absolute simplest queries, slowing down natural exploration.

**Alternative 3: Pure universal keyword search**

- **Pros:** Maximum simplicity for both the user interface and the underlying parser.
- **Cons:** Severely lacks precision. Evaluating mathematical bounds (like finding a tutor whose rate is `<50`) or filtering strictly by a subject is practically impossible to guarantee using flat string-matching.

##### Aspect: UI Context and the Query Bar

Standard commands return temporary text feedback. However, a `find` command shows a dynamically built list of Tutors, which risks heavily confusing the user if they forget their search modifiers (especially if no matches are found).

**Alternative 1 (Current choice): Dynamic Query Bar Description**

- **Pros:** Excellent UX. By parsing back the user's query into a human-readable `description` inside the `CommandResult`, the UI permanently displays the active search constraints above the list. It tells the user exactly _why_ the list looks the way it does.
- **Cons / Opportunity costs:** Modifies the standard `CommandResult` object to carry an optional `description` string, mildly coupling what is classically a Logic-tier object to the specific layout needs of the UI tier.

**Alternative 2: Standard text feedback only (e.g., "0 persons listed")**

- **Pros:** Keeps `CommandResult` pure and strictly decoupled from UI-specific display needs, reducing data passing.
- **Cons:** Severe usability flaw. If the user executes a complex filter like `find Math r/<50` and the app just says "0 persons listed" while showing an empty UI, the user immediately loses context of the active constraints governing the screen.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. The system should work on mainstream operating systems such as Windows, Linux, and macOS, as long as Java `17` or above is installed.
2. The system should be able to load and display up to 1000 Tutor Profiles within 5 seconds of application start up.
3. A user with above average typing speed should be able to perform common tasks (such as adding or editing tutor profiles) faster using commands and flags than using the mouse.
4. The system should respond to user commands within 1 second for typical usage, excluding file loading and saving operations.
5. The system should handle invalid Flags, Indices, or Parameters gracefully by displaying a clear error message instead of crashing.
6. The text file containing tutor profile data should be transferable and human-readable for portability across different machines.

    5. Test case: `edit 1 a/Clementi Ave 3 a/Orchard Road`
       Expected: No person is edited. An error message indicating that multiple values have been specified for the field `a/` is shown.
    6. Test case: `edit 1 r/50 r/60`
       Expected: No person is edited. An error message indicating that multiple values have been specified for the field `r/` is shown.
9. Editing a person with invalid field values
    1. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. At least one person exists in the list.
    2. Test case: `edit 1 p/91s34567`
       Expected: No person is edited. An error message indicating that phone number can only contain numbers and should be at least 3 digits long is shown.
    3. Test case: `edit 1 p/91`
       Expected: No person is edited. An error message indicating that phone number can only contain numbers and should be at least 3 digits long is shown.
    4. Test case: `edit 1 e/invalid-email`
       Expected: No person is edited. An error message indicating that emails should be of the format `local-part@domain` is shown.
    5. Test case: `edit 1 r/s`
       Expected: No person is edited. An error message indicating that rates can only contain numbers is shown.
10. Editing a person without changing any actual value
    1. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. The first tutor already has the name `Jane Doe`.
    2. Test case: `edit 1 n/Jane Doe`
       Expected: A success message showing the updated tutor details is displayed. The tutor profile remains unchanged.

### Finding a person

#### Negative Cases & Error Handling

1. Finding when the contact list is empty
    1. Prerequisites: Tuto must have zero Tutor contacts saved. Execute `clear` to remove all existing contacts.
    2. Test case: `find geography`
       Expected: A successful search occurs, but with no matches. The text feedback area is hidden. The blue search query bar should show `All fields: "geography"`. Below it, the result display list in the UI shows the placeholder text `No tutors found.`.
2. Attempting to restrict universal search with unsupported prefixes (Constraint Error)
    1. Prerequisites: Tuto is running (contents of the list do not matter).
    2. Test case: `find John p/91234567`
       Expected: No search is performed. Instead of the result display list and query bar, the text feedback area is shown displaying an error with a red cross icon indicating that unsupported flags (`p/`) exist when using universal search. The blue search query bar and result list are hidden.
3. Executing find without any parameters (Format Error)
    1. Prerequisites: Tuto is running.
    2. Test case: `find`
       Expected: No search is performed. The text feedback area is shown displaying an error about invalid command format. The blue search query bar and result list remain hidden.

#### Positive Cases (Universal Search)

1. Finding persons using universal search (General keywords)
    1. Prerequisites: Ensure the contact list has at least these two Tutors with these specific attributes (the rest can be any permitted value):
    - Name: "John Doe", Subject: "Math", Rate: "50"
        - Name: "Jane Doe", Subject: "Physics", Rate: "60"
    2. Test case: `find Doe`
       Expected: The text feedback area is hidden. The blue search query bar should appear and show `All fields: "Doe"`. Below it, the list is updated to display the full tutor profiles of both 'John Doe' and 'Jane Doe' (and any other tutor profiles that contain the word `Doe`).
2. Finding a person using universal search with no matching results
    1. Prerequisites: Ensure the contact list does not have anyone teaching "Chemistry" or containing the word "Chemistry" in any attribute field.
    2. Test case: `find Chemistry`
       Expected: The text feedback area is hidden. The blue search query bar should show `All fields: "Chemistry"`. Below it, the result list shows the placeholder text `No tutors found.`.

#### Complex Cases (Attribute Filtering & Combinations)

1. Finding persons using specific attribute filtering with inequalities
    1. Prerequisites: Ensure the contact list has at least these Tutors with these specific attributes (the rest can be any permitted value subject to uniqueness constraint):
    - Name: "Alice", Subject: "Physics", Rate: "40"
        - Name: "Bob", Subject: "Physics", Rate: "70"
    2. Test case: `find s/Physics r/<50`
       Expected: The text feedback area is hidden. The blue search query bar should show `Subject: "Physics" • Rate: "<50"`. The result display list should show the tutor profile for "Alice" (and other tutor profiles if condition matches), as Bob is filtered out due to his rate.
2. Finding persons using multiple instances of the same attribute type (AND / OR Logic checks)
    1. Prerequisites: Ensure the contact list has at least these Tutors with these specific attributes (the rest can be any permitted value subject to uniqueness constraint):
    - Name: "Charlie", Subject: "Math", "Chemistry"
        - Name: "David", Subject: "Chemistry", "Physics"
        - Name: "David", Subject: "Math"
    2. Test case: `find n/Charlie David s/Math s/Chemistry`
       Expected: The text feedback area is hidden. The blue search query bar should show `Name: "Charlie, David" • Subject: "Math, Chemistry"`. The result list displays only the tutor profile for "Charlie". The name prefix evaluates multiple words via OR logic (allowing either Charlie or David), but the multiple subject prefixes evaluate via AND logic simultaneously (requiring both Math AND Chemistry to be taught by the same tutor to pass).
3. Finding a person combining universal search and specific attribute filtering (AND Logic)
    1. Prerequisites: Ensure the contact list has at least these Tutors with these specific attributes (the rest can be any permitted value subject to uniqueness constraint):
    - Name: "Eve", Subject: "Math", Rate: "40"
        - Name: "Eve", Subject: "Physics", Rate: "60"
    2. Test case: `find Eve r/40-50`
       Expected: The text feedback area is hidden. The blue search query bar shows `All fields: "Eve" • Rate: "40-50"`. The result list shows only the tutor profile for "Eve" with the 'Math' subject and rate of 40 (and any other matching Tutor profiles), conforming to keywords and the defined rate boundaries successfully.

#### Adversarial & Edge Cases

1. Finding using multiple invalid format prefixes (Duplicate prefix errors)
    1. Prerequisites: Tuto is running.
    2. Test case: `find n/Alice n/Bob r/40 r/50`
       Expected: No search is performed. The text feedback area displays a red cross error indicating that multiple values were specified for single-valued fields (Name and Rate). The blue search query bar and result display list remain hidden.
2. Finding with trailing/leading whitespaces and empty attribute values
    1. Prerequisites: Tuto is running (contents of the list do not matter).
    2. Test case: `find s/`
       Expected: No search is performed. The text feedback area displays an error about invalid subject formatting (Subject cannot be empty). The blue search query bar and result list remain hidden.
    3. Test case: `find [any amount of whitespaces given] Alice`
       Expected: A successful search occurs. Extraneous surrounding spaces are ignored. The blue search query bar shows `All fields: "Alice"` and standard UI display behavior triggers showing all matching tutor profiles.
    4. Test case: `find n/ [any amount of whitespaces given] Alice [any amount of whitespaces given] r/ [any amount of whitespaces given] 50`
       Expected: A successful search occurs. Arbitrary amounts of spaces between prefixes and values do not affect the parsing. The blue search query bar shows `Name: "Alice" • Rate: "50"`.
3. Finding with different ordering of parameters
    1. Prerequisites: Ensure the contact list has at least one Tutor with the name "Alice", teaching "Math", with a rate of "50".
    2. Test case: `find r/50 s/Math n/Alice`
       Expected: A successful search occurs. The ordering of prefixes does not matter. The blue search query bar shows `Name: "Alice" • Subject: "Math" • Rate: "50"`. The result list displays the matching tutor profile.
    3. Test case: `find s/Math r/50 n/Alice`
       Expected: Same as above. The blue search query bar and result list remain consistent regardless of the input order.
4. Stress testing the find logic (extreme number of keywords/prefixes)
    1. Prerequisites: Tuto is running.
    2. Test case: `find` followed by pasting a very long string of 10,000 alphanumeric characters without spaces.
       Expected: The system should not crash or freeze. It will search for the exact 10,000-character keyword. The blue search query bar safely displays the truncated string or full string. Results will be shown if any tutor profile contains the search keyword
    3. Test case: `find n/Alice` repeated 100 times.
       Expected: No search is performed. The text feedback area displays an error indicating multiple values specified for single-valued fields (Name), preventing resource exhaustion.
5. Finding with nonsensical rate boundary formatting
    1. Prerequisites: Tuto is running.
    2. Test case: `find r/ABC`
       Expected: No search is performed. The text feedback area displays an error stating the Rate must be a valid integer. The blue search query bar and result list remain hidden.
    3. Test case: `find r/50-40`
       Expected: No search is performed. The text feedback area displays an error indicating that for a rate range, the lower bound cannot be strictly greater than the upper bound. The blue search query bar and result list remain hidden.
6. Rate integer overflow vulnerabilities (Extreme limits)
    1. Prerequisites: Tuto is running.
    2. Test case: `find r/>9999999999999`
       Expected: The system should not crash from an unhandled `NumberFormatException`. No search is performed. The text feedback area displays a red cross error indicating that the rate provided is invalid (violates valid Java integer limits or rate constraints). The blue search query bar and result list remain hidden.
7. Prefix case sensitivity and preamble swallowing (Mistyping prefixes)
    1. Prerequisites: Ensure the contact list has at least one Tutor with the name "Alice".
    2. Test case: `find N/Alice`
       Expected: The text feedback area is hidden. Because `N/` (capitalized) is not recognized as the official name prefix, the parser safely swallows it as a generic keyword. The blue search query bar shows `All fields: "N/Alice"`. Below it, the result list will show `No tutors found.` (unless a tutor profile literally contains "N/Alice").
8. Regex and Special Character injection attempts
    1. Prerequisites: Tuto is running.
    2. Test case: `find *[a-z]+* ?.* {}`
       Expected: The system should not crash due to regex compilation errors or illegal character parsing. The text feedback area is hidden. The blue search query bar safely escapes and displays `All fields: "*[a-z]+* ?.* {}"`. The result list predictably shows `No tutors found.` as it interprets the inputs as exact string literals rather than executable regular expressions.
9. Conflicting valid constraints (Mathematically/Logically impossible sets)
    1. Prerequisites: Ensure the contact list has a tutor profile named "Jane" with a rate of `50` and subject `Math`.
    2. Test case: `find Jane r/<30`
       Expected: A successful search occurs. The text feedback area is hidden. The blue search query bar shows `All fields: "Jane" • Rate: "<30"`. The result list displays `No tutors found.`. This definitively proves that even if the universal search positively matches the tutor profile "Jane", the restrictive rate filter acts as a pure AND gate to forcefully negate the inclusion, ensuring no false positives slip through.
10. Backward slashes and parser confusion techniques
    1. Prerequisites: Tuto is running.
    2. Test case: `find /n Alice /s Math \t friend`
       Expected: No search is performed. The system strictly expects `n/`, `s/`, etc. as prefixes and subject should only be alphanumeric. Since the slashes are inverted or prefixed, the parser safely swallows it as a generic keyword. The blue search query bar shows `All fields: "/n Alice /s Math \t friend"`. Below it, the result list will show tutor records that contains parts of the search keywords.
11. Empty prefix values injected before valid constraints (Syntax gap traps)
    1. Prerequisites: Tuto is running.
    2. Test case: `find n/ s/Math r/50`
       Expected: No search is performed. The text feedback area displays a constraint error stating that the Name cannot be empty (or violates validation rules). The parser successfully detects the missing value for `n/` despite `s/` immediately following it. The blue search query bar and result list remain hidden.
12. Rate attribute formatting anomalies (Zero-padding and negatives)
    1. Prerequisites: Ensure the contact list contains a tutor profile with a rate of `0`.
    2. Test case: `find r/00000000`
       Expected: A successful search occurs. The parser evaluates the heavily padded string as the integer `0`. The blue search query bar shows `Rate: "00000000"` (or mapped equivalent) and lists the matched tutor profiles matching the exact rate of 0.
    3. Test case: `find r/-5` or `find r/--50`
       Expected: No search is performed. The text feedback area displays a red cross error strongly preventing negative rates or invalid mathematical delimiters.

### Sorting the tutor list

See also: [Sorting the Tutor List](UserGuide.md#sorting-the-tutor-list-sort) in the User Guide for command format. Sorting only changes the order of the **currently displayed** tutors; it does not add or remove entries. Because `edit` and `delete` use the index shown in the list, running `sort` changes which tutor is at each index.

1. Sorting by name in ascending order
    1. Prerequisites: Use `list` so all tutors are shown. Ensure there are at least three tutors whose names sort distinctly when compared case-insensitively (e.g. "Amy", "Bob", "Carl").
    2. Test case: `sort name asc`
       Expected: The result display shows a success message such as `Sorted tutors by name in ascending order!` The Tutor List Panel lists tutors from A → Z by full name (case-insensitive). The header above the list indicates sorting by name (ascending).
2. Sorting by name in descending order
    1. Prerequisites: Same as test case 1.
    2. Test case: `sort name desc`
       Expected: Success message mentions name and **descending** order. The list shows tutors from Z → A by full name. The list header reflects descending name order.
3. Sorting by rate in ascending order
    1. Prerequisites: Use `list` so all tutors are shown. Ensure there are at least three tutors with **different** hourly rates.
    2. Test case: `sort rate asc`
       Expected: Success message mentions rate and **ascending** order. The list shows lowest rate first, then increasing. The list header reflects sorting by rate (ascending).
4. Sorting by rate in descending order
    1. Prerequisites: Same as test case 3.
    2. Test case: `sort rate desc`
       Expected: Success message mentions rate and **descending** order. The list shows highest rate first. The list header reflects sorting by rate (descending).
5. Tie-break when two tutors share the same rate
    1. Prerequisites: Use `list`. Ensure two tutors have the **same** rate but **different** names (e.g. rate `50`, names "Zoe" and "Amy"). Optionally add a third tutor with a different rate so ordering is easier to see.
    2. Test case: `sort rate asc`
       Expected: Tutors are ordered by rate as usual; for the two with the same rate, the one whose name comes first alphabetically (case-insensitive) appears above the other (e.g. "Amy" before "Zoe").
6. Case-insensitive field and order tokens
    1. Prerequisites: Use `list` with multiple tutors.
    2. Test case: `sort NAME ASC` or `sort Rate Desc`
       Expected: Same behaviour as `sort name asc` or `sort rate desc` respectively (tokens may be typed in any mixture of letter cases).
7. Sorting after a filtered list (`find`)
    1. Prerequisites: The address book has several tutors; a `find` command matches only **some** of them (e.g. same subject keyword). Run that `find` so the list shows a subset.
    2. Test case: `sort name asc`
       Expected: Only the tutors still visible after `find` are reordered; the count of tutors shown stays the same as right before `sort`. The sort applies to the displayed subset, not the full address book.
8. Listing all tutors after sorting (`list` does not clear sort)
    1. Prerequisites: Run `sort rate desc` while viewing the full list (`list`).
    2. Test case: `list`
       Expected: All tutors in the address book are shown again (any previous `find` filter is cleared). The **order** remains by rate descending (or whichever sort was last applied); the list header still describes the active sort. Success message is along the lines of `Listed all tutors!`

#### Invalid commands and errors

1. Empty or wrong number of parameters
    1. Prerequisites: Tuto is running.
    2. Test case: `sort`
       Expected: No change to list order. An error explains invalid command format and shows usage for `sort`.
    3. Test case: `sort name`
       Expected: No change to list order. Error message states that sort expects exactly two parameters (field and order), with usage.
    4. Test case: `sort name asc extra`
       Expected: Same as the previous (wrong token count).
2. Invalid sort field or order
    1. Prerequisites: Tuto is running.
    2. Test case: `sort foo asc`
       Expected: No change to list order. Error message states that the sort field is invalid and only `name` and `rate` are allowed.
    3. Test case: `sort name ascending`
       Expected: No change to list order. Error message states that the sort order is invalid and only `asc` and `desc` are allowed.

### Saving data

1. **Missing data file**
    1. Prerequisites: Tuto is not running.
    2. Delete `data/addressbook.json`, or move it aside. You may delete the whole `data` directory instead if it only contains that file.
    3. Relaunch Tuto.
    4. Expected:
    - The app starts normally.
        - The tutor list shows the **built-in sample tutors**, not an empty list.
        - The in-memory data is that sample set until the next save.
        - A new `data/addressbook.json` appears after a command that persists data (any normal command that saves).
2. **Corrupted or unreadable data file**
    1. Prerequisites: Tuto is not running.
    2. Open `data/addressbook.json` in a text editor. Replace the entire file with invalid JSON (for example a single `{` or arbitrary non-JSON text). Save.
    3. Relaunch Tuto.
    4. Expected:
    - The app starts without crashing.
        - The tutor list is **empty**; the bad file is not loaded as valid data.
        - After a successful save, the file on disk is overwritten with valid JSON for the current in-memory book (usually empty until you add tutors).
3. Adversarial case of poisoned JSON file: invalid but well-formed JSON (passes parsing, fails validation/model rules)
    1. Prerequisites: Tuto is not running.
    2. Open `data/addressbook.json` in a text editor. Enter valid JSON such as an object with duplicate tutors in the `persons` array (i.e. two identical tutor entries). Save.
    3. Relaunch Tuto.
    4. Expected:
    - The app starts without crashing.
        - The tutor list is **empty** (no tutors are shown), as the file violates model rules.
        - After a successful save, the file on disk is overwritten with valid JSON for the current in-memory book (usually empty until you add tutors).
