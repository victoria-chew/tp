## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

- At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)


<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.


The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)


The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the interactions between the `UI` and `Logic` components when executing a `Find` name command attribute on the updated UI.

<puml src="diagrams/UiFindSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions between the UI and Logic Components for the `find n/john` command" />

### Logic component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"></puml>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.


### Model component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

- stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
- stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>

### Storage component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
- inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Adding a Tutor : `add`

Adds a new tutor profile to Tuto. 
The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions between the Logic and Model components during the execution of the `add` command.

<puml src="diagrams/AddSequenceDiagram.puml" width="550"></puml>

The `add` command is processed in two main phases: parsing and execution.
The input string from user is first parsed into an `Person` object, which is then wrapped in an `AddCommand` object and executed to update the `Model` object.

The sequence of interactions is as follows:
1. The user enters the `add` command with the correct arguments, which is received by `LogicManager`.
2. `LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser` to parse the input.
3. `AddressBookParser` identifies the command word and delegates parsing to `AddCommandParser`.
4. `AddCommandParser` parses the arguments and constructs a `Person` object based on the given attributes stated in the arguments.
5. `AddCommandParser` creates an `AddCommand` object containing the `Person`.
6. The `AddCommand` is returned to `LogicManager`.
7. `LogicManager` executes the command by calling `AddCommand#execute(Model)`.
8. `AddCommand` performs validation checks:
   - checks if the person already exists, 
   - checks if the same phone and email already exists. 
9. If all checks pass, the `Person` is added to the `Model`.
10. A `CommandResult` is created and returned to the user.

#### Alternative flows
- If the input format from user is invalid, a `ParseException` is thrown during parsing and the `command` object is not created.
- If the person already exists in the address book, a `CommandException` is thrown and the operation is aborted.
- If the phone or email already exists, a `CommandException` is thrown and the operation is aborted.
---

### Uniqueness Constraints

To ensure data integrity, the application enforces uniqueness constraints on each `Person`.

#### Current Implementation

The uniqueness of a `Person` is determined by the following fields:
- Phone number
- Email address

Duplicate checks are performed in `AddCommand` and `EditCommand` before delegating to the model.
If a duplicate is detected, a `CommandException` is thrown immediately with an appropriate error message.

If any of the following conditions are met:
- A person with the same phone number already exists
- A person with the same email address already exists

The operation is rejected and an appropriate error message is shown to the user.

Duplicate checks are performed in the following priority:
1. Phone number
2. Email address

This ensures that name conflicts are detected first, followed by contact information conflicts.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: What defines a duplicate person**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use phone number, and email address as uniqueness constraints
    - Pros: Prevents duplicate entries effectively and maintains clean data
    - Cons: May be restrictive in cases where users share names or contact details

- **Alternative 2:** Use full object equality
    - Pros: Simpler implementation
    - Cons: Allows duplicate entries with identical contact details

**Aspect: Rates are restricted to whole numbers**

  - **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Rates are restricted to whole numbers
      - Pros: Reflects common real-world practice, where tutors typically state their hourly rates as whole numbers
      - Cons: Does not account for edge cases where fractional rates (e.g. $25.50/hour) may be used

  - **Alternative 2:** Rates allow decimal values
      - Pros: More flexible and accommodates all possible pricing formats
      - Cons: Adds unnecessary complexity for a feature that is rarely used in practice
    
#### Class Diagram

The following class diagram shows the key classes involved in enforcing uniqueness constraints,
and how they interact structurally.

`AddCommand` and `EditCommand` depend on the `Model` interface to perform duplicate checks.
`ModelManager` implements `Model` and delegates to `AddressBook`, which contains a
`UniquePersonList` that stores all `Person` objects.

### Finding a Tutor : `find`

Finds a tutor profile saved in Tuto. The sequence diagrams below illustrate the interactions between the UI, Logic, and Model 
components during the execution of the `find` command.

The `find` command is processed in two main phases: parsing the query to construct the appropriate predicate, and executing the search to update the `Model` and `UI`.

The sequence of interactions is as follows:
1. The user enters the `find` command with the search keywords, which is received by `LogicManager`.
2. `LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser` to parse the input.
3. `AddressBookParser` identifies the command word and delegates parsing to `FindCommandParser`.
4. `FindCommandParser` parses the arguments and constructs a predicate based on the search criteria.
5. `FindCommandParser` creates a `FindCommand` object containing the constructed predicate.
6. The `FindCommand` is returned to `LogicManager`.
7. `LogicManager` executes the command by calling `FindCommand#execute(Model)`.
8. `FindCommand` calls `Model#updateFilteredPersonList(...)` using the predicate to filter the displayed list.
9. `FindCommand` generates a `CommandResult` containing the `foundPersons` (the filtered list) and a `description` of the search query. This result is returned to the user interface.
10. The UI receives the `CommandResult`. Notably, it updates the query bar (`ResultDisplay`) to display the description of what was searched, then lists the internally matched tutors.

The diagram below shows how the UI interactions are executed after the command returns.

<puml src="diagrams/UiFindSequenceDiagram.puml" />

The diagram below illustrates the interactions inside the Logic and Model components.

<puml src="diagrams/FindSequenceDiagram.puml" />

The diagram below shows the parser classes involved in handling the `find` command.

<puml src="diagrams/FindParserClassDiagram.puml" width="500"/>

#### Alternative flows
- If the search arguments are empty or invalid, a `ParseException` is thrown during parsing and the `Command` object is not created.
- If the search yields no matches, `FindCommand` still executes successfully. The displayed list is simply empty, but the query bar in the UI is still appropriately updated to show what keywords were searched.


#### Search Modalities

The `find` command supports three modalities of searching, enabling users to find tutor profiles flexibly:

**1. General Search (Universal Search)**
Users can provide keywords without any prefixes. 
- **Example:** `find alice math`
- **Implementation:** The `FindCommandParser` treats these prefix-less keywords as the preamble. It extracts these keywords and constructs a `UniversalSearchPredicate`. This predicate evaluates if *any* of the tutor's relevant fields (such as name, subject, or tags) match the specified keywords.

**2. Attribute Filtering**
Users can search for specific attributes using prefixes (e.g., `n/`, `s/`, `r/`, `t/`). 
- **Example:** `find n/alice r/10-30`
- **Implementation:** `FindCommandParser` parses the mapped values for each specified prefix. 
  - It creates specific predicates for each attribute (e.g., `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `RateRangePredicate`, `SubjectContainsKeywordsPredicate`). 
  - Multiple prefixes are supported. For subjects and tags (e.g., `s/Math s/Physics`), multiple occurrences are combined using OR logic within their respective predicates.
  - Rate filtering dynamically handles various mathematical boundaries (e.g., exact `r/50`, ranges `r/40-60`, or inequalities `r/<50`).

**3. General Search + Attribute Filtering**
Users can combine general search keywords with specific attribute filters to effectively refine their results.
- **Example:** `find alice r/<50`
- **Implementation:** When `FindCommandParser` detects both a preamble and specific prefixes, it validates that only supported refinement prefixes (`n/`, `s/`, `r/`, `t/`) are used to prevent logical conflicts. It then constructs a **combined predicate** by chaining the `UniversalSearchPredicate` and the attribute-specific predicates together using a logical `AND` (`Predicate.and()`). This ensures the displayed list heavily filters the broad keyword search against the strict attribute constraints.

#### Design Considerations

##### Aspect: Search Modalities and User Experience

The design of the `find` command heavily factors in natural human searching patterns and the progressive disclosure of complexity.

- **Low-information exploration (Typing less to discover more):** When a user is unsure of exact profile details, they logically gravitate towards broad, search-engine-style keyword searches. The **General (Universal) Search** caters to this by requiring zero prefixes, lowering the cognitive barrier and friction to entry. If you don't know exactly what you want, you type less.
- **High-information precision (Determinate filtering):** When a user knows exactly what they want (e.g., a specific name under a strict budget), they need structured tools to zero-in on candidates. **Attribute Filtering** provides rigorous control. The more you know, the more you filter.
- **Progressive refinement:** The **General Search + Attribute Filtering** modality allows users to cast a wide net initially, completely naturally, and optionally tack on filters to eliminate noise once they see the broad results.

**Alternative 1 (Current choice): Flexible multi-modal search (Universal + Attributes)**
- **Pros:** Scales dynamically with the user's familiarity and immediate needs. It models real-world workflows seamlessly.
- **Cons / Opportunity costs:** Significantly increases the architectural complexity of the `FindCommandParser`. It introduces edge-case ambiguities where universal keywords logically clash with prefix arguments, requiring us to enforce explicit validation rules (e.g., restricting which abstract prefixes can confidently be used alongside universal search) and write much more comprehensive unit tests for combinations.

**Alternative 2: Strict prefix-only search (Default behavior)**
- **Pros:** Extremely straightforward to implement and parse. It completely eliminates ambiguity in user intent.
- **Cons:** High friction UX. Users are forced to remember and strictly type specific prefixes (`n/`, `s/`) even for the absolute simplest queries, slowing down natural exploration.

**Alternative 3: Pure universal keyword search**
- **Pros:** Maximum simplicity for both the user interface and the underlying parser.
- **Cons:** Severely lacks precision. Evaluating mathematical bounds (like finding a tutor whose rate is `<50`) or filtering strictly by a subject is practically impossible to guarantee using flat string-matching.

##### Aspect: UI Context and the Query Bar

Standard commands return temporary text feedback. However, a `find` command shows a dynamically built list of Tutors, which risks heavily confusing the user if they forget their search modifiers (especially if no matches are found).

**Alternative 1 (Current choice): Dynamic Query Bar Description**
- **Pros:** Excellent UX. By parsing back the user's query into a human-readable `description` inside the `CommandResult`, the UI permanently displays the active search constraints above the list. It tells the user exactly *why* the list looks the way it does.
- **Cons / Opportunity costs:** Modifies the standard `CommandResult` object to carry an optional `description` string, mildly coupling what is classically a Logic-tier object to the specific layout needs of the UI tier.

**Alternative 2: Standard text feedback only (e.g., "0 persons listed")**
- **Pros:** Keeps `CommandResult` pure and strictly decoupled from UI-specific display needs, reducing data passing.
- **Cons:** Severe usability flaw. If the user executes a complex filter like `find Math r/<50` and the app just says "0 persons listed" while showing an empty UI, the user immediately loses context of the active constraints governing the screen.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. The system should work on mainstream operating systems　such as Windows, Linux, macOS as long as Java `17` or above installed.
2. The system should be able to load and display up to 1000 Tutor Profiles within 5 seconds of application start up.
3. A user with above average typing speed should be able to perform common tasks (such as adding or editing tutor profiles) faster using commands and flags than using the mouse.
4. The system should respond to user commands within 1 second for typical usage, excluding file loading and saving operations.
5. The system should handle invalid Flags, Indices, or Parameters gracefully by displaying a clear error message instead of crashing.
6. The text file containing tutor profile data should be transferable and human-readable for portability across different machines.
7. The application should be usable without an internet connection.
8. The application should not require an installer and should run from a single directory without external dependencies beyond Java `17`.
9. The application should be packaged into a single JAR file to simplify distribution and testing.

### Glossary

- **ArgumentMultimap**: A data structure that stores mappings between prefixes and their associated values after tokenization
- **Argument Tokenization**: The process of splitting user input into key-value pairs based on prefixes.
- **Command**: The entire line of text entered by the user (containing the command word, flags, and parameters) to execute a specific task.
- **CommandResult**: An object that encapsulate the result of a command execution, including feedback to be displayed to the user.
- **Command Word**: The first word of a Command (e.g., add, edit, delete) that identifies the action to be performed.
- **Duplicate Entry**: A tutor profile with the same phone number or email as an existing profile.
- **Exception**: An error condition (e.g. ParseException) that interrupts normal execution and is handled gracefully.
- **Human-readable**: A file format (like JSON or Text) that allows data to be read and edited using a standard text editor, without Tuto.
- **Index**: The number displayed next to a tutor's name in the contact list (e.g., the 3 in 3. John Doe). Used to select a specific tutor for commands like edit or delete.
- **JAR File**: The file format used to distribute Tuto, allowing it to run on any computer with Java installed without a setup wizard.
- **Model**: The component responsible for storing and managing application data.
- **Parameter**: The specific information provided after a Flag (e.g., John is the parameter for /n).
- **Person**: A data entity representing a tutor profile, containing attributes such as name, phone, email, address, subject, rate and tags.
- **Prefix**: A specific prefix (e.g., /n, /p, /e) used to identify the type of data following it.
- **Rate**: The cost per hour for hiring the tutor.
- **Subject**: The academic discipline a tutor teaches (e.g., Math, Physics).
- **Tag**: A customisable label user can put on a tutor profile.
- **Tutor Profile**: The complete set of data (Name, Phone, Email, etc.) stored for one specific tutor.
